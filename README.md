# tiny essay editor

This is a simple collaborative Markdown editor built in React, with inline format preview and inline commenting.

It's built on [automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge) and [automerge-repo](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo) for CRDT-based storage and sync. It uses [Codemirror](https://codemirror.net/) for markdown editing UI, and [automerge-codemirror](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-codemirror) to connect to Codemirror.

## Status

This app is primarily intended for internal use at Ink & Switch for editing essays, so there are some features that are specialized towards that use case. We don't plan to develop it into a general-purpose editor that anyone can use for anything. But of course, it can edit any Markdown document too. If you want to actually use this editor in earnest, you might want to fork it to build your own ideas.

Hopefully the code serves as a useful sample for building apps based on automerge-repo, automerge-codemirror, and React.

## Usage

- If you visit the root domain the app will make a new doc. Or you can hit the New button.
- Once you have a doc, the URL will update with a doc ID. If you share that URL to another browser/device, it should sync live. Hold on to the URL if you want to come back to that doc!

## Feature set

- Edit Markdown with inline format preview
- Write inline comments + replies
- Live sync through Automerge
- Save out .md file with a Download button
- Typeset similarly to Ink & Switch essays

## Run it

Setup the automerge submodule

```
git submodule init
git submodule update --init --remote
```

Check out the `version-control-project` in the vendored automerge-repo. By default git checks out a detached HEAD so we need to manually switch to the actual branch.

```
cd src/vendor/vendored-automerge-repo
git checkout version-control-project
```

Install and build automerge repo

```
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Install dependencies for tiny-essay-editor and start the dev server

```
cd ../../..
yarn
yarn dev
```

To pull in updates for the submodule run the following update command

```
git submodule update --remote --rebase
```

> --remote ensures we are getting the latest changes
> --rebase ensures that the changes are pulled into the checked out "version-control-branch" instead of checking out a detached HEAD

## Dual deployment

This app is designed for normal webapp deployment as well as experimental deployment to an internal I&S platform. The code is almost entirely shared but there are two entry points:

- `src/main.tsx` is the normal app entry point
- `src/index.ts` is an experimental entry point which just exports some functions to a host environment
